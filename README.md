# real-space-tight-binding-for-topological-systems
This repository provides a comprehensive, hands-on tutorial for exploring topological phases of matter through the lens of real-space tight-binding (TB) calculations. Our primary focus is the Haldane model, a seminal example of a Chern insulator, which exhibits a quantized Hall effect without requiring an external magnetic field, and local props.
